    <h2>Why ‚Äî Because AI shouldn‚Äôt be a black box</h2>
    <p>
      Let‚Äôs be honest: generative AI is fascinating‚Ä¶ and opaque as hell.
      You enter a prompt, magic happens, and boom ‚Äî it answers like a super-intelligent alien librarian. But behind the scenes? Proprietary models, undisclosed training sets, hallucinations, ethical debates, and layers upon layers of hype.
    </p>
    <p>
      At AI Duel, we believe that AI literacy is no longer optional. If we‚Äôre going to work with these models, rely on them, or even just joke around with them, we need to understand how they behave.
      Not in a lab. Not in a whitepaper. But in real-world, day-to-day interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We built AI Duel to make that exploration accessible ‚Äî and fun. Because the best way to understand intelligence (even artificial) is to challenge it.

    <h2>How ‚Äî Letting the models speak for themselves</h2>
    <p>
      The idea is simple: take a single prompt, send it to multiple AI models, and show you the answers side by side ‚Äî anonymously. No logos. No labels. No preconceived notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, the user, get to vote for the best one. No need to be an expert. Just follow your gut. Which answer is more useful? More accurate? Funnier? Stranger? Smarter?
    </p>
    <p>
      This way, you‚Äôre not just using AI ‚Äî you‚Äôre learning to discern it.
      Over time, you‚Äôll start noticing the quirks: the way one model always gives bullet points, or another tries too hard to be witty, or how a third is oddly philosophical at 2AM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every round is a chance to sharpen your instincts, challenge your assumptions, and occasionally say, ‚ÄúWait, that one was DeepSeek?!‚Äù üò≤
    </p>
    <p>
      We‚Äôre also tracking votes and feedback over time to build a transparent, community-driven leaderboard. Not for the sake of competition (okay, maybe a little), but to create an evolving map of how different models perform across different use cases ‚Äî creative writing, code, explanations, jokes, reasoning, and more.

    <h2>What ‚Äî A playground, a lab, and a bit of a game</h2>
    <p>
      AI Duel is a free, community-powered platform where anyone can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Submit prompts to challenge multiple AI models</li>
      <li>Get side-by-side, anonymous responses in real-time</li>
      <li>Vote for the most convincing answer without knowing which model wrote it</li>
      <li>Access public leaderboards to see who‚Äôs consistently killing it (or flopping)</li>
      <li>Enter ‚ÄúChallenge Mode‚Äù to guess the model behind each response (harder than it sounds!)</li>
      <li>Explore stats and patterns ‚Äî which model is best at Python? At sarcasm? At bedtime stories?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We support all the major players ‚Äî ChatGPT (GPT-4), Claude, Mistral, DeepSeek, and more as the field evolves. And we don‚Äôt play favorites. Our mission is not to crown a winner, but to help users build intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of AI Duel as your personal Turing Arena.
      A space where large language models are no longer behind glass, but right there in the ring ‚Äî answering your questions, fighting for your vote, and occasionally embarrassing themselves.
