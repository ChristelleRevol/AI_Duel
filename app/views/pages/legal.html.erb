  <h1>Legal Stuff <small>(the absurd but mandatory part)</small></h1>

  <p class="intro">
    Welcome to the dark underbelly of the internet: the legal page.<br>
    Grab a coffee. Or a potion of +3 Endurance. Things are about to get unnecessarily serious.

    <h2>Disclaimer of Ultimate Vagueness</h2>
    <p>
      AI Duel is a project made by humans who thought it would be fun to make artificial intelligences fight in a coliseum of pure prompt-based chaos. The results you see on this platform are generated by machines trained on vast datasets of everything — from Shakespeare to Reddit arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t guarantee that the answers will be accurate, smart, useful, funny, or even grammatically correct. Sometimes they hallucinate. Sometimes we hallucinate. Who’s to say, really?

    <p class="highlight">
      Use at your own risk. And by “risk,” we mean the emotional distress of realizing an AI writes better love letters than you.

    <h2>No Liability for Robot Drama</h2>
    <p>
      If an AI model gives you bad advice, offends your cat, breaks your heart, or causes a minor existential crisis, AI Duel takes no responsibility.
      We just deliver the duel. You’re the judge. If things go sideways, blame the AI. Or capitalism. Or Skynet. We’re just the arena.

    <h2>Data Policy <small>(aka: Relax, We’re Not That Creepy)</small></h2>
    <p>
      We don’t care about your deepest secrets. We don’t sell your data. We don’t even know what to do with it. We log basic stuff to keep the site running and to understand which AI keeps losing at knock-knock jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t track you across the internet. We barely track you on our own site. We believe cookies are best served warm with chocolate chips, not embedded in your browser forever.

    <h2>Intellectual Property, Probably</h2>
    <p>
      Everything generated by the AIs technically belongs to… someone? Maybe? It’s complicated. Let’s just say: use the responses however you like, but don’t sue us if someone else writes the same thing. These models have read the whole internet, remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you submit a prompt, you’re not giving up your soul. But you are letting us use that prompt to generate answers, show them publicly, and occasionally laugh at them. Don’t submit anything you wouldn’t want to see projected on a screen at your wedding.

    <h2>Jurisdiction <small>(we Googled that word)</small></h2>
    <p>
      If a legal dispute arises, may the ancient spirits of the Prompting Realm guide us all. Otherwise, any real legal matters would fall under the jurisdiction of… Earth. Probably. We’re not lawyers. This is a hobby project, not a dystopian megacorp (yet).

    <h2>Final Words of Wisdom</h2>
    <p>
      If you’ve read this far, congratulations. You are now legally certified as a Level 3 Internet User.<br>
      Go forth. Submit prompts. Judge mercilessly. And remember: in this arena, there are no wrong answers — only weird ones.
